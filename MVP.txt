The killer MVP demo capabilities (by role)

1) Product Owner (Insurance Product / Underwriting)

As a Product Owner, I can create a new parametric product from a template in minutes in order to launch faster and test new offers without a big IT project.

As a Product Owner, I can configure payout tiers and eligibility parameters in a guided UI in order to control product economics without relying on engineers.

As a Product Owner, I can preview the product logic as a readable rule flow in order to validate intent with legal/compliance quickly.

2) Claims Ops Lead

As a Claims Ops Lead, I can run a realistic claim simulation and get an instant decision in order to prove straight-through processing potential and reduce manual handling.

As a Claims Ops Lead, I can see a human-readable decision trace (what rules fired, what data was used) in order to resolve disputes faster and train staff consistently.

As a Claims Ops Lead, I can export an “audit JSON” (decision + inputs + version hash) in order to support QA, complaints handling, and regulator questions.

3) QA / Governance / Compliance

As a QA manager, I can run a regression test pack against a model version in order to catch breaking changes before production.

As a Compliance officer, I can compare two versions and see what changed and which decisions would flip in order to approve renewals confidently.

As a Governance owner, I can publish a model version with an approval trail in order to enforce controlled change management.

4) Data / Integration Engineer (the “will this be a nightmare?” person)

As an Integration Engineer, I can send a minimal claim event payload to a Decision API and receive decision + payout + trace in order to integrate with low blast radius.

As an Integration Engineer, I can switch external data sources (stub vs live flight status) in order to test safely without production dependencies.

As an Integration Engineer, I can monitor decision outcomes and errors in a simple dashboard in order to operate the service reliably.

5) Exec Sponsor (Head of Claims / COO)

As an Exec Sponsor, I can see quantified change impact (how many decisions change, payout delta) in order to decide business rollout with confidence.

As an Exec Sponsor, I can see time-to-decision and automation rate metrics in order to justify investment with a clear business case.

If you only demo 5 things, demo these

Template → configured product in minutes (time-to-market)

Instant decision on a real-looking claim (automation)

Readable trace + exportable audit artifact (defensibility)

Version compare + regression pack (renewal/change safety)

Minimal integration contract (low IT risk)

Everything else is noise until you have pull.



Context:



Sell a narrow SKU first:

“Flight Delay Benefit Decisioning + Audit Trace”

Who buys first (most realistic):



Travel insurers / travel MGAs who want a differentiated product fast

Distributors later (OTA/airline), usually once there’s an insurer capacity partner in place

Pricing (simple):



base platform fee (covers governance, audit, uptime)

usage fee (per active policy / per decision / per booking protected)

You win when:



your fee is a fraction of saved handling cost + gained conversion value

The hard punchline (so you don’t build the wrong thing)

Your “super generic supports any contract + reinsurance” engine is not your MVP.

Your MVP is:



a repeatable template library + primitives

a tiny configuration UI

a decision API

testing + diff/impact report

one event source connector

If you can’t show:



“we shipped a product in days”

“we can safely update it”

“we reduced touch time to ~zero”



…then nobody rational buys.

What I recommend you do next (very concrete)

Choose wedge: Flight arrival delay benefit (one product, one jurisdiction pack, one flight data source).

Build the demo console first: template → parameters → run claim → show trace.

Build 20–30 primitives max: keep modeling “LEGO-like”, not “programming language”.

Add model versioning + regression runner: your renewal nightmare antidote.

Pilot with a design partner: prove savings + improved customer experience with a small integration.

And yes: there are already companies selling parametric flight disruption experiences, which is good news because it proves demand (and tells you the bar). Blink Parametric
